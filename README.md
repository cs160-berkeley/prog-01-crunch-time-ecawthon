### Bonus:
Both the input and the output can be chosen from a drop-down list. Set one to
"Calories" and  the other to an exercise to see how many minutes or repetitions
of that exercise will burn a given number of calories, or to
  see how many calories a particular workout will burn.

So, according to the tables provided, 100 squats burn the same number of
calories as 4.44 minutes of jumping jacks.
